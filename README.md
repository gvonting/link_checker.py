# link_checker.py

This project is a work in progress. It is my attempt at creating a locally hosted website checker which checks for changes to a website. 

The app can currently:
- Create a csv list of added links
- Screenshot and record text data of a website
- Update csv file with new info
- Compare old website data to a current copy, recording the new data if there is a difference

I have finished the most important basic functions of the app and now need to do:

- Frontend development
- Error checking and bug mitigation / fixes
- Add functionality
- Connect the frontend user interface to the backend python functions with a framework called Eel: https://github.com/python-eel/Eel
- Compile project into a single executable
